# Autonomous-Car-using-Deep-Learning-and-Computer-Vision
The main purpose of this project is to become familiar with AI techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and to apply them to real world problems, i.e., autonomous vehicle.

# Phase 1: Assembly
In this phase, we assembled the Autonomous vechicle. Below you will see a link directing you to our images of the process.

# Phase 2: Setting-Up Raspberry Pi
During this phase, we experienced a few issues with our micro-sd card. We attempted multiple times to connect using our original one but ultimately had to receive a different sd card from our professor. With the second one, we were able to move forward quickly. During this set, we followed the given powerpoint without issues. This setup allowed us to code our vehicle so that we were able to move forward adn learn how to make it move.

This image shows the process we took to complete a cloud connection.

This image shows how the connection will look once it is completed and how we would be able to access the vehicle itself.

This shows the window that opens that allows for us to type the code for the vehicle.
